print("- Environment shows max 200-888 actions at once")
print("- After scheduling 172 jobs, remaining jobs can't be shown")

print("2. Use hierarchical action space (first pick job, then machine)")
print("3. Increase max_valid_actions to 10,000")
print("4. Change environment to always show unscheduled jobs")

print("\nRecommended approach:")

print("schedule ~40% of jobs due to environment limitations.")
print("\nFor production:")
print("1. Run multiple scheduling rounds")
