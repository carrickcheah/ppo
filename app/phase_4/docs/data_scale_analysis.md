# Phase 4 Data Scale Analysis

## Current Situation

We have a **scale mismatch** between training and production data:

### Training Data (Synthetic)
- **Job durations**: 0.5 - 8.0 hours
- **Average**: ~2.5 hours per job
- **Total workload**: ~1,250 hours (500 jobs Ã— 2.5h)
- **Target makespan**: <45 hours (achievable)

### Production Data (Real)
- **Job durations**: 0.03 - 332.36 hours
- **Average**: 36.4 hours per job
- **Total workload**: 14,951 hours (411 jobs)
- **Theoretical minimum**: 100.3 hours
- **Realistic target**: 120-150 hours

## The Models We Have

1. **Original Model** (1M steps)
   - Trained on synthetic data
   - Achieved 49.2h on synthetic test data
   - Cannot handle real production scale

2. **Extended Model** (1.5M steps)
   - Continued training on synthetic data
   - Optimized hyperparameters
   - Still cannot handle real production scale

## Options Moving Forward

### Option A: Full Retraining
- Start from scratch with real production data
- Train for 1-2M steps
- Target: 120-150 hour makespan
- Time: 8-16 hours of training

### Option B: Deploy with Synthetic Model
- Use the existing models
- Create a data transformation layer
- Scale down real jobs to match training distribution
- Risk: May not perform well on real constraints

### Option C: Hybrid Approach
- Use current model as starting point
- Fine-tune on real production data
- Shorter training time (500k steps)
- Balance between options A and B

## Recommendation

**Option A: Full Retraining** is the most reliable approach:
1. We have the infrastructure ready
2. Real data is available and validated
3. Training will produce a model that matches production reality
4. 120-150h makespan is a realistic and valuable target

The <45h target was based on synthetic data and is not achievable with the actual production workload of 14,951 hours.
