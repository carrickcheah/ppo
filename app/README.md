# Deep Reinforcement Learning Scheduling System

## Project Status: Phase 4 Strategy Development - Ready for Training ✅

### Pure DRL System (/app_2) - Current Status
- **Phase 1 & 2**: ✅ COMPLETE - Environment and PPO model implemented
- **Phase 3**: ✅ COMPLETE - Toy stages tested (best: 56.2% vs 80% target)
- **Phase 4**: ✅ CREATED - 4 strategy environments for focused testing
- **Data**: 109 real production jobs, 145 real machines from MariaDB
- **Next Step**: Train Phase 4 strategy environments

## Latest Updates (July 28, 2025)

### Phase 3 Results - RL Limitations Discovered
- **Toy Stage Performance** (target: 80% completion):
  - toy_easy: 100% ✅ (simple enough for RL)
  - toy_normal: 56.2% ❌ (best achieved)
  - toy_hard: 30.0% ❌ (significant gap)
  - toy_multi: 36.4% ❌ (multi-machine complexity)
- **Failed Improvement Attempts** (all made performance worse):
  - Action Masking with MaskablePPO: 25% (vs 56.2% baseline)
  - Better Reward Engineering: Negative rewards, 0% scheduling
  - Schedule All Environment: 31.2% (model memorized sequences)
  - Simple Penalty Reduction: 12.5% (model stuck on invalid actions)
- **Root Causes Identified**:
  - Only ~10% of random actions are valid
  - Sequential dependencies create cascading constraints
  - Some jobs have impossible deadlines
  - Pure RL struggles with combinatorial optimization

### Phase 4 - Strategy Development Created
- **Response to Phase 3 Results**: Created focused strategy environments
- **4 Small-Scale Scenarios** (all using real production data):
  - **Small Balanced**: 20 jobs, 12 machines - General scheduling test
  - **Small Rush**: 20 jobs, 12 machines - Urgent deadline handling
  - **Small Bottleneck**: 20 jobs, 10 machines - Resource constraint management
  - **Small Complex**: 20 jobs, 12 machines - Multi-machine job coordination
- **Custom Reward Structures**: Tailored rewards per scenario
- **Progressive Difficulty**: Balanced → Rush → Bottleneck → Complex
- **Training Configuration**: 500K-1M timesteps per strategy

## System Architecture

### Pure DRL System - Game-Based Learning
```
MariaDB → Real Data → Curriculum Stages → PPO Training → Optimal Schedule
   ↓          ↓              ↓                ↓              ↓
[Prod DB] [109 jobs]   [16 stages]    [Transformer]    [Gantt Chart]
          [145 mach]   [Progressive]   [Attention]      [Visualized]
```

### Key Components
1. **Data Layer**
   - Real production data from MariaDB
   - 16 curriculum stage snapshots
   - Multi-machine job support

2. **Environment**
   - Hard constraints as physics
   - Improved reward structure
   - No working hours in training

3. **PPO Model**
   - MLP policy network
   - Action masking for validity
   - Curriculum learning stages

## Real Production Data

### Data Statistics
- **Total Jobs**: 109 real job families from database
- **Total Tasks**: 220+ individual tasks with sequences
- **Machines**: 145 real machines with actual names
- **Multi-Machine Jobs**: Jobs requiring 2-5 machines simultaneously
- **Processing Times**: Real calculations from capacity formulas
- **Job Prefixes**: JOAW, JOST, JOTP, JOTRDG, JOPRD (all real)

### Curriculum Stages (All Using Real Data)
1. **Foundation** (Stages 1-4): ✅ TESTED - Best: 56.2% (gap to 80% target)
2. **Strategy** (Stages 5-8): ✅ PHASE 4 - Created 4 focused environments
3. **Scale** (Stages 9-12): 📋 PENDING - Depends on Phase 4 results
4. **Production** (Stages 13-16): 📋 PENDING - Requires successful smaller scale

## Quick Start

### Training Phase 4 Strategies
```bash
cd /Users/carrickcheah/Project/ppo/app
uv run python ../app_2/phase4/train_strategies.py
```

### Testing Environment
```bash
cd /Users/carrickcheah/Project/ppo/app
uv run python ../app_2/phase3/test_curriculum_env_real.py
```

### Evaluating Models
```bash
cd /Users/carrickcheah/Project/ppo/app
uv run python ../app_2/phase3/evaluate_and_visualize.py --all
```

## Next Steps

### Immediate Actions
1. **Train Phase 4**: Run all 4 strategy environments
2. **Evaluate Performance**: Target >50% completion on 2+ scenarios
3. **Analyze Results**: Determine if RL is viable for this problem

### Future Considerations
1. **If Phase 4 Succeeds**: Scale to medium/large environments
2. **If Phase 4 Fails**: Consider hybrid approaches (RL + heuristics)
3. **Alternative**: Hierarchical RL or imitation learning
4. **Deployment**: Only after achieving reasonable performance

## Success Metrics

### Achieved ✅
- 100% real production data integration
- Fixed all critical issues (machine IDs, rewards, action validity)
- Implemented full curriculum learning pipeline
- Created evaluation and visualization tools
- Discovered RL limitations through extensive testing

### Phase 4 Success Criteria
- >50% completion rate on 2+ strategy environments
- Learn different strategies for different scenarios
- Determine viability of pure RL approach
- Guide decision on hybrid vs pure RL architecture

## Key Discoveries from Phase 3

1. **RL Limitations**: Pure RL achieved only 56.2% vs 80% target
2. **Action Space Challenge**: Only ~10% of actions are valid
3. **Sequential Dependencies**: Order constraints heavily impact learning
4. **Every "Improvement" Failed**: Action masking, reward engineering all made it worse
5. **Phase 4 Response**: Created focused strategy environments to test specific challenges
