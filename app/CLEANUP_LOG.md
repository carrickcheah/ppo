# Directory Cleanup Log

## Date: 2025-07-22

### Files Moved from Root Directory

The following files were moved from the app root directory to their appropriate locations:

#### Test Files (moved to `tests/`)
- `test_system.py` - System validation and status checks
- `test_production_connection.py` - Production database connection tests  
- `test_api_integration.py` - API integration test suite

#### Script Files (moved to `scripts/`)
- `run_model_comparison.py` - Model comparison script
- `main.py` - Main entry point script
- `setup_production.py` - Production setup script

#### Removed Duplicates
- `run_api_server.py` - Removed from root (duplicate of scripts/run_api_server.py)

### Current Directory Structure

The root directory is now clean with only essential configuration files:
- `__init__.py`
- `pyproject.toml` 
- `uv.lock`
- `README.md`
- `.gitignore`
- `mcp.json`

All Python scripts are now properly organized in their respective directories:
- Tests in `tests/`
- Scripts in `scripts/`
- Source code in `src/`
- Phase-specific code in `phase_4/` and `phase_5/`

### To Run Scripts

After cleanup, use these commands:
```bash
# Run API server
uv run python scripts/run_api_server.py

# Run model comparison
uv run python scripts/run_model_comparison.py

# Run tests
uv run python -m pytest tests/test_api_integration.py
uv run python tests/test_system.py
```
