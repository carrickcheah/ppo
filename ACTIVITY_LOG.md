  - Successfully applied indexes to production database
- **Frontend UI Restructuring**:
  - Added tabbed navigation to separate Dashboard, Jobs Chart, and Machine Chart views
  - Implemented `ScheduleContext` for sharing schedule data between components
  - Created `JobsChart.tsx` component:
    - Job-centric Gantt view with families on Y-axis
    - Time range selector (7, 14, 30, 60 days)
    - Color-coded jobs (green: on-time, purple: medium priority, red: high priority)
    - Current time indicator and hover tooltips
  - Created `MachineChart.tsx` component:
    - Resource-centric view showing machine utilization
    - Machine names with utilization percentages
    - Similar time range and color coding
    - Machine utilization summary statistics
  - Modified `ScheduleForm.tsx`:
    - Removed default 20 jobs input field
    - Removed 'GENERATE SAMPLE' button
    - Removed 'LOAD FROM FILE' button
    - Added auto-load functionality on component mount

### 2025-07-23 - Front2 PPO Integration & Real Data Display
- **Front2 Configuration for PPO Backend**:
  - Created separate frontend instance (`front2`) dedicated to PPO backend only
  - Fixed import resolution error for `@/lib/utils` by creating missing utility file
  - Removed all constraint programming and fallback logic from DataCacheContext
  - Updated configuration to point all API calls to PPO backend (port 8000)
  - Fixed CORS configuration in PPO backend settings
- **Real Production Data Integration**:
  - Fixed DataCacheContext to use PPO schedule response directly
  - Removed jobDataService calls that tried to fetch from non-existent endpoints
  - PPO backend successfully schedules 100 tasks from 27 unique jobs
  - Verified all jobs use real production prefixes (JOST, JOTP, JOAW)
  - No synthetic or sample data - 100% real production data from MariaDB
- **Gantt Chart Task Display Fix**:
  - Fixed issue showing only 27 merged jobs instead of 100 scheduled tasks
  - Modified GanttChartDisplay to show individual tasks, not merged jobs
  - Updated ppoAdapter to generate unique task IDs with process notation
  - Task ID format: `JOBID_PROCESSCODE-INSTANCE/TOTAL` (e.g., `JOST25050298_CP01-123-1/3`)
  - All 100 tasks now display as separate rows on Y-axis
- **Key Achievements**:
  - Front2 successfully uses only PPO backend for scheduling
  - Real production data displayed correctly (100 tasks, 27 unique jobs)
  - Fixed working hours to use default values (PPO doesn't have this endpoint)
  - Gantt chart shows full task details as requested by user
  - System ready for production use with real data

### 2025-07-23 - Pure DRL Scheduling System Architecture & Implementation
- **Pure Deep Reinforcement Learning Design**:
  - Designed completely new architecture in `/app_2/` for pure DRL approach
  - No hardcoded rules or strategies - AI learns everything from experience
  - Game-based paradigm: User defines physics, AI learns to play optimally
  - Identified root cause of sequence violations: batch scheduler splitting job families
  - Decision to solve through pure learning instead of hardcoded fixes
- **Environment Implementation (Phase 1 Complete)**:
  - Created `SchedulingGameEnv` - Gymnasium environment for scheduling game
  - Implemented `RulesEngine` - Enforces only hard constraints (physics):
    - Sequence constraints within job families
    - Machine compatibility checking
    - No time overlap enforcement
    - Working hours constraints
  - Built `RewardFunction` - Provides learning signals:
    - Completion rewards, importance bonuses
    - Urgency multipliers based on deadlines
    - Efficiency and load balancing rewards
    - All configurable via YAML (no hardcoding)
  - Developed data layer:
    - `DBConnector` for MariaDB integration

    - `environment.yaml` - Game rules and reward settings
    - `training.yaml` - PPO hyperparameters and curriculum
    - `deployment.yaml` - Production API configuration
  - Zero hardcoding - all parameters externalized
- **Project Structure**:
  - Clean separation of concerns in `/app_2/`:
    - `/src/environment/` - Game mechanics
    - `/src/data/` - Data loading
    - `/src/model/` - (Phase 2) PPO networks
    - `/src/training/` - (Phase 2) Training pipeline

  - Continuous learning and adaptation
  - Simple interface: Raw data in, optimized schedule out

### 2025-07-24 - Data Pipeline Fixes & Multi-Machine Understanding
- **Critical Schema Understanding**:
  - `Machine_v` contains machine IDs (not names or types)
  - Multiple IDs like "57,64,65,66,74" mean job requires ALL 5 machines simultaneously
  - This is NOT a choice - job occupies all listed machines at once
- **Processing Time Formula Implemented**:
  - When `CapMin_d = 1` and `CapQty_d > 0`: 
    - Hours = (JoQty_d / (CapQty_d * 60)) + (SetupTime_d / 60)
  - Verified with real data: 500 units at 6/min + 10min setup = 1.56 hours
  - CycleTime_d removed (always 0 in production)
- **Database Schema Updates**:
  - Added `IsImportant` column from tbl_jo_txn (boolean flag)
  - Added `CapQty_d`, `CapMin_d` for capacity calculations
  - Job ID now uses DocRef_v + Task_v for better identification
- **Key Findings from Testing**:
  - 81 pending jobs across 19 families
  - 5 multi-machine jobs found (requiring 2-5 machines simultaneously)
  - 12 jobs have no assigned machines (need handling)
  - Processing times range from 0.3 to 65 hours
- **Constraint Clarification**:
  - Hard: Sequence, machine requirements, no overlap
  - Soft: Deadlines, importance, efficiency, load balancing
  - Deployment: Working hours (not part of training)

### 2025-07-24 - Environment Updates for Multi-Machine Jobs
- **Multi-Machine Job Support Implemented**:
  - Updated `SchedulingGameEnv` to handle jobs requiring multiple machines simultaneously
  - Created `_schedule_multi_machine_job()` method that:
    - Finds earliest time ALL required machines are available
    - Schedules job on all machines for entire duration
    - Tracks multi-machine status in job assignments
  - Multi-machine jobs receive bonus reward for complexity
- **Action Masking Enhanced**:
  - Updated `get_action_mask()` to properly handle multi-machine jobs
  - Valid to select ANY required machine - environment schedules on ALL
  - Added `_check_multi_machine_availability()` helper method
- **Working Hours Removed from Training**:
  - Per user request, working hours NOT enforced during training
  - Updated `_adjust_for_working_hours()` to return time as-is
  - Changed config `enforce_working_hours: false`
  - Marked as deployment-only constraint in documentation
- **Testing Results**:
  - Successfully tested with synthetic multi-machine job (3 machines)
  - Verified all machines occupied for entire duration
  - Action masking correctly identifies valid machine choices
  - Production data test: 81 jobs, 145 machines working correctly
  - Sequence constraints properly enforced
  - Edge cases handled (invalid machines, out of bounds)

### 2025-07-23 - Database Integration & Production Data Testing
- **Database Schema Integration**:
  - Updated `DBConnector` to work with actual production schema
  - Jobs structured with `tbl_jo_txn` (transactions) and `tbl_jo_process` (process steps)
  - Each transaction (`TxnId_i`) contains multiple sequential processes (`RowId_i`)
  - Jobs grouped by `DocRef_v` (e.g., JOAW25060101) serving as family identifier
  - Machine compatibility stored in `Machine_v` field as comma-separated names
- **Production Data Characteristics**:
  - Successfully connected and tested with real data:
    - 233 pending jobs across 52 unique transactions
    - 145 active machines with 24+ different type IDs
    - Jobs maintain proper sequence structure (1/3, 2/3, 3/3)
  - Complex working hours discovered:
    - Different schedules per day (Mon-Thu: 18-19, Fri: 6-18, Sat: 6-13)
    - 8 different break periods including lunch, tea breaks, and machine downtime
  - Processing times appear to be in minutes (e.g., 61.0 hours may be 61 minutes)
- **Data Mapping Implementation**:
  - `DocRef_v` → family_id (groups related jobs)
  - `RowId_i` → sequence number within family
  - `Machine_v` → parsed to machine_types list
  - `DifficultyLevel_i >= 3` → is_important flag
  - `CycleTime_d + SetupTime_d` → total processing time
- **Key Findings**:
  - Job families properly maintain sequencing requirements
  - Machine type mapping successfully extracted from database
  - Working hours more complex than initially assumed

### 2025-07-24 - Phase 2 Complete: Pure DRL Implementation
- **Database Schema Corrections**:
  - Fixed critical misunderstanding: `Machine_v` contains machine IDs, not names
  - When `Machine_v = "57,64,65,66,74"`, job requires ALL 5 machines SIMULTANEOUSLY
  - Updated processing time calculation using capacity formula:
    - When `CapMin_d = 1` and `CapQty_d != 0`: `Hours = JoQty_d / (CapQty_d * 60)`
  - Removed working hours from training environment (deployment only)
- **Phase 1.5 - Data Pipeline Fixes**:
  - Updated `db_connector.py` with correct schema mapping
  - Fixed processing time calculation with capacity formula

  - Created comprehensive training plan optimized for M4 Max (40-core GPU, 48GB RAM)
  - Expanded TODO.md with 50+ specific Phase 3 activities across 6 steps
  - Added detailed beginner-friendly explanations for TensorBoard, Live Metrics, Snapshots
- **Step 1: Data Preparation (Complete)**:
  - Created `create_snapshots_from_existing.py` to generate data variations
  - Generated 5 main snapshots:
    - Normal: Standard 295 jobs distribution
    - Rush: 80% urgent orders (LCD < 7 days)
    - Heavy: 150% job load (443 jobs)
    - Bottleneck: Concentrated on 20% of machines
    - Multi-machine: 30% multi-machine jobs
  - Created 4 edge case snapshots:
    - Same machine: Multiple jobs requiring same machine
    - Cascading: Sequential dependencies across families
    - Conflicts: Time-critical overlapping deadlines
    - Multi-complex: Complex multi-machine scenarios
- **Curriculum Learning Implementation**:

    - Stages 5-7: Small scale (30-50 jobs, 30 machines)
    - Stages 8-11: Medium scale (100-200 jobs, 50-100 machines)
    - Stages 12-15: Near-production (250-400 jobs, 140 machines)

  - Fixed with machine ID mapping (database IDs: 1,2,3...10,11,12,15,16...)
  - Stage 7 error: Observation space mismatch (expected 593, got 73)
  - Root cause: Different stages have different numbers of machines

### 2025-07-24 - Small Rush Training Issue: 0% Utilization Analysis
- **Critical Problem Identified**:
  - Small_rush stage achieving 0% machine utilization - model not scheduling ANY jobs
  - Model learned to "do nothing" strategy to avoid penalties
  - All 3 training iterations produced identical results (-168.10 reward)
- **Root Cause Analysis**:
  1. **Reward Structure Issue**:
     - Invalid action penalty: -0.1 (small)
     - Late job penalty: up to -1.0 (large)
     - Rush orders have tight deadlines (8 days for 5-sequence jobs)
     - Model correctly learned that -0.1 < -1.0 (do nothing is better)
  2. **Rush Order Challenge**:
     - snapshot_rush.json: 80% jobs have LCD < 7 days
     - Example: JOTP25070237 needs 124+ hours processing, only 192 hours available
     - Most jobs guaranteed to be late if scheduled
  3. **Missing Positive Incentives**:
     - No completion bonus in reward function
     - Only penalties (late, idle time) but no rewards for progress
     - Model has no incentive to take risks
  4. **Low Exploration**:
     - Entropy coefficient 0.01 - insufficient exploration
     - Model stuck in local minimum early
     - Never discovered any successful strategies
- **Code Issues Found**:
  - Reward calculation in `_calculate_reward()` only penalizes
  - No positive reward for job completion
  - Efficiency reward is always negative (penalizes idle time)
  - Importance reward only adds more penalty if late
- **Environment Configuration Problems**:
  - Test shows observation space mismatch (821 vs 593)
  - Missing 'name' field in stage configuration
  - Stage definitions inconsistent between training and testing
- **Required Fixes**:
  - Add completion bonus to reward function (+1.0 per job completed)
  - Reduce late penalty magnitude or use graduated penalties
  - Increase entropy coefficient to 0.05+ for exploration
  - Create "rush_order" reward profile that tolerates some lateness
  - Fix environment configuration for consistent observation spaces

### 2025-07-25 - Phase 3 Complete: Curriculum Learning with Real Production Data
- **Critical Data Requirement Enforcement**:
  - User strongly emphasized: "Why snapshot u not use real data? i mean real job name, real machine, why?"
  - Discovered Phase 3 was using synthetic data instead of real production data
  - User deleted all Phase 3 files to enforce restart with real data
  - Updated CLAUDE.md with MANDATORY real data requirements
- **Phase 3 Complete Reimplementation**:
  - Created `ingest_real_data.py` to fetch 100% real production data from MariaDB:
    - Fetched 109 real jobs with actual job IDs (JOAW, JOST, JOTP prefixes)
    - Retrieved 145 real machines with actual names (OV01, ALDG, BDS01, etc.)
    - Created 16 curriculum stage snapshots using ONLY real data
    - Saved all data to `/app_2/data/` directory as required
  - Implemented `curriculum_env_real.py` with all critical fixes:
    - Machine ID mapping (0-based actions to 1-based database IDs)
    - Fixed info dict key: 'action_valid' not 'valid_action'
    - Improved reward structure with completion bonuses (+50.0)
    - Action bonus (+5.0) for taking any valid action
    - Handles multi-machine jobs correctly
  - Created comprehensive `train_curriculum.py`:
    - 16-stage progressive training from toy to production
    - Performance gates between stages
    - Checkpoint saving and resuming capability
    - Tensorboard logging for monitoring
    - Test mode for quick validation
  - Built `evaluate_and_visualize.py` for assessment:
    - Generates Gantt charts showing job schedules
    - Calculates utilization, completion rates, makespan
    - Creates training progress visualizations
    - Saves all outputs to `/app_2/visualizations/phase3/`
- **Key Technical Achievements**:
  - ALL data now from real MariaDB production database
  - No synthetic or dummy data anywhere in Phase 3
  - Fixed critical reward issues preventing "do nothing" behavior

### 2025-07-28 - Extensive Training for 80% Toy Stage Completion
- **Objective**: Train toy stages (toy_normal, toy_hard, toy_multi) to achieve 80% scheduling completion
- **Current Best Performance**:
  - toy_easy: ✓ 100% (already perfect)
  - toy_normal: 56.2% (gap: 23.8% to target)
  - toy_hard: 30.0% (gap: 50.0% to target)
  - toy_multi: 36.4% (gap: 43.6% to target)
- **Critical Discovery**: Through exhaustive random search, proved 100% completion IS possible:
  - toy_normal: Found action sequences achieving 100%
  - toy_hard: Found action sequences achieving 100%
  - toy_multi: Found action sequences achieving 95.5%
  - This proves optimal solutions exist, but RL struggles to find them
- **Training Approaches Attempted**:
  1. **Standard PPO with Reward Shaping**: Achieved 25-56% range
  2. **Pure Completion Focus**: Massive rewards (1000+) for scheduling, ignored deadlines
     - Result: Improved toy_normal to 56.2%, others plateaued
  3. **Phased/Curriculum Learning**: Start with completion, gradually add constraints
     - Result: No significant improvement, models stuck in local optima
  4. **Targeted 80% Training**: Balanced rewards optimized for 80% target
     - Result: Failed to reach target after 500k timesteps
  5. **Ultimate Training**: Exponential rewards, high exploration
     - Result: Still plateaued below targets
  6. **Adjusted Hyperparameters**: Lower learning rate (3e-4), smaller batches, deeper networks
     - Result: Training showed promise but timed out after 425k steps
- **Why PPO Models Struggle**:
  1. **Sparse Valid Actions**: Only ~10% of random actions are valid schedules
  2. **Conflicting Objectives**: Completion rewards vs deadline penalties create local optima
  3. **Sequential Dependencies**: Early decisions heavily constrain later options
  4. **Action Space Complexity**: MultiDiscrete spaces with many invalid combinations
- **Key Files Created**:
  - `/app_2/phase3/train_all_toys_to_perfection.py` - Completion-focused wrapper
  - `/app_2/phase3/train_toys_achievable.py` - Phased training approach
  - `/app_2/phase3/train_to_80_percent.py` - Targeted 80% training
  - `/app_2/phase3/analyze_and_fix_100.py` - Proved 100% is possible
  - `/app_2/phase3/train_adjusted_hyperparams.py` - Final hyperparameter tuning
  - `/app_2/phase3/visualize_best_performance.py` - Performance analysis charts
  - `/app_2/phase3/SCHEDULE_TEST_SUMMARY.md` - Comprehensive results summary
- **Visualization Created**: Performance analysis chart saved to `/app_2/visualizations/phase3/toy_stages_performance_analysis.png`
- **Recommendations for Future Work**:
  1. **Hierarchical RL**: Decompose into job selection → machine assignment
  2. **Imitation Learning**: Use the 100% sequences we discovered
  3. **Better State Representation**: Include lookahead and capacity information
  4. **Alternative Algorithms**: Consider SAC/TD3 or model-based RL
  5. **Hybrid Approach**: Use RL for rough scheduling + heuristics for refinement
- **Conclusion**: Despite proving 100% is achievable, standard PPO struggles with scheduling complexity. The gap between proven achievability (100%) and RL performance (30-56%) highlights fundamental challenges in applying RL to combinatorial optimization. Extensive experiments provide valuable insights for future system design.
