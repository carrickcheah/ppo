### 2025-07-19 17:45-18:12 - Major README.md Update
- Updated README to reflect current Phase 4 status (152 machines, 40% training complete)
- Removed all outdated week-by-week implementation details
- Consolidated completed phases into summary sections
- Added current performance benchmarks table
- Removed extensive code examples (500+ lines)
- Added Key Lessons Learned and Next Steps sections
- Final README is now concise and reflects actual project state

### 2025-07-19 22:00-22:20 - Phase 4 Training Completion
- Resumed Phase 4 training from 400k checkpoint
- Successfully completed training to 1M timesteps
- Created resume_phase4_training.py script to handle checkpoint loading
- Fixed evaluation compatibility issues with FullProductionEnv
- Training completed with 152 machines and hierarchical state compression
- Final model saved to app/models/full_production/final_model.zip
- Encountered JSON truncation issue in training_results.json

### 2025-07-19 22:21-22:30 - Phase 4 Results Analysis & Reporting
- Disabled automatic generic tool logging in settings.local.json
- Created extract_phase4_results.py to evaluate final model performance
- Extracted key metrics: 49.2h makespan, 100% completion rate
- Discovered excellent scaling: 3.8x machines â†’ 2.5x makespan (sub-linear)
- Generated comprehensive Phase 4 report in docs/reports/
- Identified utilization metric issue (showing 0%) - needs investigation
- Ready for API development and production deployment

### 2025-07-19 22:30-22:45 - Production Test Run & Visualizations
- Created test_production_run.py and test_and_visualize.py for model testing
- Generated multiple visualization types:
  - Performance dashboard with scaling metrics
  - Phase progression analysis
  - Schedule comparison (PPO vs baselines)
  - Job and machine view Gantt charts
- Fixed empty visualization issue - model was working but data extraction was faulty
- Confirmed model schedules all 172 jobs successfully
- Important jobs (60.5%) are prioritized correctly by PPO

### 2025-07-19 22:45-22:55 - Real Data Discovery & Debug
- Discovered system was using synthetic/generated data, not real production data
- Found complete data ingestion system at /app/src/data_ingestion/ingest_data.py
- Debugged model behavior - confirmed PPO prioritizes important jobs first
- Identified that job IDs like "7874-1" are synthetic, not real work orders
- Real system should use actual MariaDB data with JOAW/JOST prefixes

### 2025-07-19 22:55-23:05 - Real Data Enforcement Implementation
- Updated CLAUDE.md with mandatory real data requirements section
- Created load_real_production_data.py to fetch data from MariaDB
- Modified FullProductionEnv to forbid synthetic data generation
- Added validation to ensure only real job IDs and machine names are used
- Created test_real_data_enforcement.py to validate compliance
- System now raises errors if synthetic data is attempted
- All future runs MUST use real production data from database2025-07-19 23:02:41 - Tool used | Files changed: 22

### 2025-07-19 23:05-23:06 - CLAUDE.md Permission Rule Update
- Added mandatory folder creation permission rule to CLAUDE.md
- Rule requires explicit user approval before creating any new directories
- Prevents unintentional directory structure changes
- Maintains project organization control
