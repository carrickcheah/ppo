### 2025-08-06 - app3 Simplified PPO System Architecture & Planning

- **app3 Project Initialization**:
  - Created new simplified PPO scheduling system in `/app3/` directory
  - Designed architecture leveraging pre-assigned machines from database
  - Simplified action space: Select task to schedule next (not job-machine pairs)
  - 94% of tasks have pre-assigned machines, removing search complexity

- **Data Analysis & Understanding**:
  - Analyzed existing JSON snapshots (10, 20, 40, 60, 80, 100, 150, 200, 250, 300, 500 jobs)
  - All data contains real production jobs with JOST, JOTP, JOPRD prefixes
  - Identified task structure: sequence, process_name, processing_time, assigned_machine
  - Found 145 real machines from MariaDB (e.g., PP09-160T-C-A1, WH01A-PK)
  - Confirmed material_arrival dates present for constraint checking

- **Constraint Simplification**:
  - Sequence constraints: Tasks within family must complete in order
  - Machine assignment: Use pre-assigned machine or any available (for 6% without)
  - No time overlap: One task per machine at a time
  - Material availability: Cannot schedule before arrival date
  - Removed working hours constraint from training (deployment only)
  - No capable_machines complexity needed

  - Added PPO configuration: MLP (256-128-64), LR 3e-4, batch 64
  - Defined reward structure: +100 on-time, +50 early, -100 late per day

- **Key Design Decisions**:
  - Action space: Discrete(n_tasks) instead of MultiDiscrete([n_jobs, n_machines])
  - State representation: task_ready, machine_busy, urgency_scores, sequence_progress
  - Curriculum training: 6 stages with 100k timesteps each
  - Performance gate: >80% success rate to progress stages
  - No hardcoded scheduling logic - all decisions from PPO model

- **Implementation Plan Created**:
  - Phase 1: Environment with constraints and rewards
  - Phase 2: PPO model with action masking
  - Phase 3: Curriculum training pipeline
  - Phase 4: Evaluation and visualization
  - Phase 5: YAML configuration management
  - Phase 6: API integration and deployment
