# Small Rush 0% Utilization Fix Summary

## Problem
The Small Rush stage (50 jobs, 20 machines, 80% urgent orders) had 0% utilization because the model learned to "do nothing" to avoid late penalties.

## Root Cause
1. **Imbalanced rewards**: Late penalty (-1.0) was larger than invalid action penalty (-0.1)
2. **No completion incentive**: Base completion reward (10.0) was too small
3. **Low exploration**: Entropy coefficient (0.01) prevented trying new strategies
4. **Rush challenge**: 80% of jobs had LCD < 7 days, many guaranteed to be late

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Updated Reward Structure (`scheduling_game_env.py`)
- **Completion reward**: 10.0 → 50.0 (5x increase)
- **Action bonus**: Added +5.0 for taking ANY valid action
- **Invalid penalty**: -20.0 → -5.0 (via config)
- **Graduated late penalties**: -1.0 per day late (capped at -20)
- **On-time bonus**: +10.0 for completing before deadline
- **Progress bonus**: +10.0 × completion_rate
- **Urgency bonus**: Positive reward for urgent jobs (not penalty)

### 2. Updated Configuration (`environment.yaml`)
```yaml
rewards:
  completion_reward: 50.0      # Was 10.0
  action_bonus: 5.0           # NEW
  invalid_action_penalty: -5.0  # Was -20.0
  urgency_multiplier: 20.0     # Was 50.0
  wait_penalty: 0.05          # Was 0.1
```

### 3. Increased Exploration (`phase3_curriculum_config.yaml`)
- Global entropy: 0.01 → 0.05
- Small Rush specific: 0.1 (extra exploration)
- Added `rush_order` reward profile with 50% focus on completion

### 4. Stage-Specific Settings
```yaml
small_rush:
  reward_profile: "rush_order"
  ent_coef: 0.1  # Extra exploration
```

## Results
- Model now takes actions and gets positive rewards
- Average reward per action: ~0.23 (was 0)
- Utilization: >0% (was 0%)
- Ready for full training

## Next Steps
1. Run full training: `cd phase3 && python improve_stage_performance.py small_rush`
2. Target metrics:
   - Utilization: >70%
   - On-time delivery: >50%
   - Complete all 50 jobs
3. Once successful, proceed to Stage 7 (Small Bottleneck)

## Key Insight
The fix ensures that taking action (even if late) is ALWAYS better than doing nothing. This prevents the "paralysis" behavior in high-pressure scenarios.
