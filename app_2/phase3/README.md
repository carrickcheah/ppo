# Phase 3 Implementation Summary

## Overview
Phase 3 implements curriculum learning for the PPO-based production scheduler using 100% REAL production data from MariaDB.

## Completed Components

### 1. Real Data Ingestion (ingest_real_data.py)
- Fetches REAL production data from MariaDB database
- Creates 16 curriculum stage snapshots with actual job IDs (JOAW, JOST, JOTP prefixes)
- Saves snapshots to /app_2/data/ directory
- Implements diverse job selection for training variety
- Sample output: 109 real jobs, 145 real machines

### 2. Curriculum Environment (curriculum_env_real.py)
- Loads ONLY from real production data snapshots
- Implements critical fixes:
  - Machine ID mapping (0-based actions to 1-based machine IDs)
  - Fixed info dict key: uses 'action_valid' not 'valid_action'
  - Improved reward structure with completion bonuses
  - Multi-machine job support
- Supports all 16 curriculum stages
- Customizable reward profiles for different training objectives

### 3. Training Script (train_curriculum.py)
- Implements 16-stage progressive training
- Performance gates between stages
- Checkpoint saving for each stage
- Tensorboard logging support
- Resume capability from any stage
- Test mode for quick validation
- Hyperparameter scheduling per stage

### 4. Evaluation Tools (evaluate_and_visualize.py)
- Generates Gantt charts from trained models
- Evaluates model performance metrics:
  - Utilization rate
  - Completion rate
  - Makespan
- Creates training progress visualizations
- Saves all visualizations to /app_2/visualizations/phase3/

```

## Data Location
- Real data snapshots: `/app_2/data/stage_*_real_data.json`
- Each snapshot contains REAL job IDs and machine names from production
- No synthetic data is used anywhere in Phase 3

## Next Steps
1. Run full 16-stage training:
   ```bash
   cd /Users/carrickcheah/Project/ppo/app
   uv run python ../app_2/phase3/train_curriculum.py
   ```

2. Monitor training progress:
   ```bash
   tensorboard --logdir /app_2/phase3/tensorboard
   ```

3. Evaluate trained models:
   ```bash
   uv run python ../app_2/phase3/evaluate_and_visualize.py --all
   ```

## Key Achievements
- Successfully integrated REAL production data from MariaDB
- Fixed critical issues (machine ID mapping, reward structure)
- Created comprehensive training and evaluation pipeline
- All tests pass with real data validation
- Ready for full curriculum training
