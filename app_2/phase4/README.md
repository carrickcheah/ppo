# Phase 4: Strategy Development

## Overview

Phase 4 tests PPO's ability to handle different scheduling scenarios through 4 strategy-specific environments:

1. **Small Balanced** (20 jobs, 12 machines)
   - Balanced workload with mixed deadlines
   - Tests general scheduling ability

2. **Small Rush** (20 jobs, 12 machines)
   - Tight deadlines and high time pressure
   - Tests prioritization and urgency handling

3. **Small Bottleneck** (20 jobs, 10 machines)
   - High job-to-machine ratio (2:1)
   - Tests resource allocation efficiency

4. **Small Complex** (20 jobs, 12 machines)
   - Multi-machine jobs and complex dependencies
   - Tests constraint handling

## Key Features

### 1. Strategy-Specific Rewards
Each environment has customized reward structures:
- **Balanced**: Moderate rewards across all metrics
- **Rush**: High penalties for lateness, bonuses for critical jobs
- **Bottleneck**: Utilization bonuses, lower late penalties
- **Complex**: Sequence/dependency bonuses, multi-machine coordination

### 2. Real Production Data
All scenarios use subsets of real production data from MariaDB:
- Actual job IDs (JOAW, JOST prefixes)
- Real processing times and deadlines
- Authentic machine capabilities

### 3. Progressive Difficulty
- **Balanced**: Baseline scenario
- **Rush**: Time pressure
- **Bottleneck**: Resource constraints
- **Complex**: Multiple constraints

## Usage

### Test Environments
```bash
python test_environments.py
```

### Train All Strategies
```bash
python train_strategies.py
```

### Train Single Strategy
```bash
python train_strategies.py --strategy small_balanced
```

## Expected Outcomes

Success criteria (70%+ completion rate):
- **Small Balanced**: Should achieve 70-80%
- **Small Rush**: Expected 60-70% (harder)
- **Small Bottleneck**: Expected 65-75%
- **Small Complex**: Expected 50-60% (hardest)

## Lessons from Toy Stages

Based on Phase 3 results:
- Simple PPO achieved 56.2% on toy_normal
- Action masking made performance worse (25%)
- Complex reward engineering failed
- Best approach: Keep it simple with moderate penalties

## Next Steps

After achieving reasonable performance (>50% success rate on 2+ scenarios):
1. Scale to medium environments (100-500 jobs)
2. Test on large scale (500+ jobs)
3. Deploy to production

## Training Parameters

Using best hyperparameters from toy stages:
- Learning rate: 3e-4
- Batch size: 64
- Network: [256, 256] for both policy and value
- Entropy: 0.05 (balanced exploration)
- Training steps: 500K-1M depending on complexity
