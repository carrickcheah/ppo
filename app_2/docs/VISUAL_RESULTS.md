# Visual Results - What We Built Today

## Before vs After

### BEFORE (Problem)
```
Job: JOST25070194_CO02-010-2/3
Machine_v: "57,64,65,66,74"  
Interpretation: ❌ Pick ONE machine from list
Result: Only 1 machine busy, others available = WRONG!
```

### AFTER (Solution)  
```
Job: JOST25070194_CO02-010-2/3
required_machines: [57,64,65,66,74]
Interpretation: ✓ Need ALL 5 machines simultaneously
Result: ALL 5 machines busy for 2.58 hours = CORRECT!
```

## Processing Time Formula Results

### Example Calculations:
```
Job: JOST25070192_CA01-051-2/3
JoQty_d: 2500 units
CapQty_d: 1 unit/min  
CapMin_d: 1
SetupTime_d: 10 min

Calculation:
Hours = (2500 / (1 * 60)) + (10 / 60)
      = 41.67 + 0.17
      = 41.84 hours ✓
```

## Environment Capabilities

### 1. Multi-Machine Scheduling
```
Step 1: User selects Job JOST25070220 on Machine PP01
Step 2: Environment checks: needs [PP01, PP15]
Step 3: Schedules on BOTH machines
Step 4: Both occupied 0:00 - 44:01 hours
```

### 2. Sequence Enforcement
```
Family: JOST25070195
- Job 1/4: Can schedule ✓
- Job 2/4: Must wait for 1/4 ✓
- Job 3/4: Must wait for 2/4 ✓
- Job 4/4: Must wait for 3/4 ✓
```

### 3. Action Masking
```
Total possible actions: 81 jobs × 145 machines = 11,745
Valid actions (masked): ~500-1000 depending on state
Invalid actions blocked: ~10,000+
```

```

## Environment State Example

### Initial State:
```
Time: 0.00 / 168.00 hours
Completed: 0 / 81 jobs
All machines: AVAILABLE
Next jobs: All sequence 1 jobs
```

### After 10 Steps:
```
Time: 19.25 / 168.00 hours  
Completed: 10 / 81 jobs
Machines busy: 15 / 145
Next jobs: Mix of sequence 1 & 2
```
