            Your project implements a reinforcement learning solution for industrial production scheduling using Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO). Here's the breakdown for
            students:

            Environment üè≠

            - Custom Gymnasium environments modeling a real factory floor
            - Progressive complexity: Toy (2 machines) ‚Üí Medium (10) ‚Üí Scaled (40) ‚Üí Full Production (152 machines)
            - Handles real production data from MariaDB database

            State üìä

            The state represents the current factory status as a continuous vector:
            - Machine loads (how busy each machine is)
            - Job statuses (which jobs are scheduled/completed)
            - Processing times for pending jobs
            - Current simulation time
            - Full production uses state compression: 505 ‚Üí 60 features

            Action üéØ

            Discrete actions representing scheduling decisions:
            - Assign job X to machine Y
            - Wait (do nothing this timestep)
            - Uses action masking to prevent invalid assignments

            Reward üí∞

            Multi-objective reward function balancing:
            - Job completion (+10 base)
            - Efficiency bonuses (load balancing, utilization)
            - Deadline adherence (urgency and LCD buffer bonuses)
            - Setup time minimization
            - Invalid action penalties (-20)

            Agent ü§ñ

            - PPO algorithm from Stable Baselines3
            - Policy network: MLP with [64, 64] hidden layers
            - Training: Parallel environments, checkpointing, transfer learning
            - Hyperparameters: Learning rate decays from 3e-4 (toy) to 1e-5 (production)

            The project demonstrates curriculum learning - starting with simple problems and progressively increasing complexity while transferring learned behaviors to harder
            environments.
