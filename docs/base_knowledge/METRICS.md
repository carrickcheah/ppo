            ⏺ PPO Metrics Explained

            PPO Uses Different Metrics Than Traditional ML

            PPO doesn't use F1 score or traditional loss functions. Instead, it uses reinforcement learning 
            specific metrics:

            1. Primary PPO Training Metrics:

            Policy Loss (Main Optimization Target)

            policy_loss = -min(ratio * advantages, clip(ratio, 1-ε, 1+ε) * advantages)
            - Measures how well the policy improves while staying close to previous policy
            - Lower is better
            - Clipped to prevent too large updates

            Value Loss

            value_loss = MSE(V(s), returns)
            - How well the model predicts future rewards
            - Lower is better
            - Helps with variance reduction

            Entropy Loss

            entropy_loss = -entropy(π)
            - Encourages exploration
            - Higher entropy = more exploration
            - Prevents premature convergence

            2. Environment-Specific Metrics (What We Care About):

            For production scheduling:
            - Episode Reward - Total reward per episode (higher is better)
            - Makespan - Total time to complete all jobs (lower is better)
            - Machine Utilization - % of time machines are busy (higher is better)
            - Setup Time Ratio - % of time spent on setup vs production (lower is better)
            - Constraint Violations - Number of break time violations (should be 0)

            3. PPO Training Progress Metrics:

            # From tensorboard logs
            - explained_variance  # How well value function explains returns (0-1, higher better)
            - approx_kl          # KL divergence between old and new policy (monitor stability)
            - clip_fraction      # Fraction of updates that were clipped (typically 0.1-0.3)
            - learning_rate      # Current learning rate
            - n_updates          # Number of policy updates

            4. What We Monitor in Our System:

            # In our training callbacks
            metrics = {
                'episode_reward': mean_reward,
                'episode_length': mean_length,
                'makespan': episode_makespan,
                'utilization': machine_utilization,
                'setup_ratio': setup_time / total_time,
                'jobs_completed': completed_jobs / total_jobs,
                'deadline_violations': late_jobs_count
            }

            5. Key Differences from Supervised Learning:

            | Aspect     | Supervised Learning     | PPO/RL                            |
            |------------|-------------------------|-----------------------------------|
            | Target     | Fixed labels            | Maximize cumulative reward        |
            | Loss       | Cross-entropy, MSE      | Policy gradient loss              |
            | Metrics    | Accuracy, F1, Precision | Episode reward, Success rate      |
            | Training   | Epochs over dataset     | Episodes of interaction           |
            | Evaluation | Test set performance    | Policy performance in environment |

            For Production Scheduling, We Focus On:

            1. Training Stability:
                - Policy loss decreasing
                - Value loss converging
                - KL divergence stable
            2. Business Metrics:
                - Jobs completed on time
                - Machine utilization %
                - Average job lateness
                - Setup time minimization
            3. Learning Progress:
                - Episode reward increasing
                - Exploration vs exploitation balance
                - Policy entropy (not too low)

            The key is that PPO optimizes for long-term cumulative reward, not single-step accuracy like supervised
