# Boolean vs Priority System Comparison Report

## Executive Summary

We successfully implemented and tested a boolean importance system (`is_important: True/False`) as a replacement for the 1-5 priority system. The results show comparable performance with a simpler, clearer signal for the neural network.

## Implementation Details

### Boolean System Design
- **True**: Important jobs (10% of total + all CF prefix products)  
- **False**: Normal jobs (90% of total)
- Average deadline for important jobs: 2.1 days
- Average deadline for normal jobs: 36.1 days

### Key Changes from Priority System
1. Simplified from 5 priority levels to 2 states
2. Clearer reward signal: +20 bonus for important jobs
3. Easier to understand violations (important vs not important)

## Training Results

### Performance Comparison

| Metric | Priority (1-5) | Boolean | Difference |
|--------|----------------|---------|------------|
| **Constrained Makespan** | 27.9h | 28.0h | +0.1h (+0.4%) |
| **Unconstrained Makespan** | 27.4h | 27.6h | +0.2h (+0.7%) |
| **Constrained Efficiency** | 95.3% | 95.0% | -0.3% |
| **Unconstrained Efficiency** | 97.1% | 96.4% | -0.7% |

### Key Findings

1. **Similar Performance**: Boolean system achieves nearly identical results to the 1-5 priority system
   - Less than 1% difference in all metrics
   - Both systems successfully schedule all 172 tasks

2. **Training Behavior**:
   - Constrained model: Smooth learning curve, reached ~3350 reward
   - Unconstrained model: Started negative (-4000) but recovered to ~2300 reward

3. **Violation Analysis** (Unconstrained):
   - Boolean: 132 violations per episode (76.6% of decisions)
   - 0 violations were urgency-justified
   - PPO consistently ignores importance without constraint

## Advantages of Boolean System

### 1. Simplicity
- Binary decision: important or not
- Matches real-world thinking: "Is this urgent?"
- Easier for operators to understand

### 2. Clearer Neural Network Signal
- Binary feature (0 or 1) vs 5-level encoding
- Stronger reward differentiation (+20 vs +0)
- Less ambiguity in learning

### 3. Database Integration Ready
- Simple boolean field in database
- No need to map arbitrary priority numbers
- Easy to update based on business rules

### 4. Meaningful Violations
- Clear interpretation: "Chose normal over important"
- Easy to track and report
- No confusion about "Priority 3 vs Priority 4"

## Recommendation

The boolean importance system is recommended for production deployment because:

1. **Performance parity**: No loss in scheduling quality
2. **Simpler implementation**: Easier to maintain and explain
3. **Better interpretability**: Clear business meaning
4. **Database ready**: Direct mapping to boolean field

## Next Steps

1. Integrate boolean importance with database connector
2. Add working hours and holiday constraints
3. Scale to full 145 machines
4. Test with real production data

## Technical Notes

- Both models trained for 100,000 timesteps
- 4 parallel environments for faster training
- PPO hyperparameters identical between tests
- Models saved in `./models/boolean/` directory
