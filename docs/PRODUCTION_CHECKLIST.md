## Production Setup

### 1. Environment Configuration
- [ ] Update production database credentials in `.env`
- [ ] Set secure API key (replace `dev-api-key-change-in-production`)
- [ ] Configure CORS for production frontend URLs
- [ ] Set `ENVIRONMENT=production`
- [ ] Enable metrics collection

### 2. Infrastructure
- [ ] Deploy to production server
- [ ] Configure reverse proxy (nginx/Apache) for HTTPS
- [ ] Set up process manager (systemd/supervisor)
- [ ] Configure log rotation
- [ ] Set up monitoring alerts

### 3. Database
- [ ] Verify MariaDB connection from production server
- [ ] Test database queries with production data volume
- [ ] Create database backup before first run
- [ ] Set up scheduled backups
- [ ] Monitor query performance

### 4. Performance Testing
- [ ] Load test with expected production volume
- [ ] Verify <2 second response time for 170 jobs
- [ ] Test concurrent request handling
- [ ] Monitor memory usage under load
- [ ] Check CPU utilization

### 5. Safety Validation
- [ ] Test constraint validation with edge cases
- [ ] Verify break time compliance
- [ ] Check machine compatibility validation
- [ ] Test LCD date enforcement
- [ ] Validate anomaly detection thresholds

## Deployment Steps

### Phase 1: Shadow Mode (Week 1)
- [ ] Deploy API in read-only mode
- [ ] Run parallel with manual scheduling
- [ ] Log all scheduling decisions
- [ ] Compare PPO vs manual results
- [ ] Collect performance metrics

### Phase 2: Limited Production (Week 2-3)
- [ ] Route 10% of scheduling requests to PPO
- [ ] Monitor closely for issues
- [ ] Gather user feedback
- [ ] Fine-tune based on results
- [ ] Prepare rollback plan

### Phase 3: Expanded Deployment (Week 4)
- [ ] Increase to 50% of traffic
- [ ] A/B test PPO vs manual
- [ ] Measure KPIs:
  - [ ] Makespan reduction
  - [ ] On-time delivery rate
  - [ ] Machine utilization
  - [ ] User satisfaction
- [ ] Document any issues

### Phase 4: Full Production (Month 2)
- [ ] Route 100% traffic to PPO
- [ ] Keep manual as fallback
- [ ] Continuous monitoring
- [ ] Weekly performance reviews
- [ ] Plan optimization updates

## Monitoring & Maintenance

### Daily Checks
- [ ] API health status
- [ ] Error rate (<1%)
- [ ] Response times (<2s)
- [ ] Database connection
- [ ] Disk space for logs

### Weekly Reviews
- [ ] Makespan trends
- [ ] Completion rates
- [ ] User feedback
- [ ] System performance
- [ ] Error patterns

### Monthly Tasks
- [ ] Model performance evaluation
- [ ] Database optimization
- [ ] Log analysis
- [ ] Security updates
- [ ] Documentation updates

## Rollback Plan

### Immediate Rollback Triggers
- [ ] Completion rate drops below 95%
- [ ] Makespan increases >10%
- [ ] Critical constraint violations
- [ ] System crashes
- [ ] Data corruption

### Rollback Steps
1. Switch traffic to manual scheduling
2. Preserve PPO logs for analysis
3. Notify stakeholders
4. Investigate root cause
5. Fix and re-test before retry

## Success Metrics

### Target KPIs (Month 1)
- [ ] Makespan: <45 hours (from 49.2h)
- [ ] Completion: 100% maintained
- [ ] Utilization: >80% (from 78%)
- [ ] LCD Compliance: >95% maintained
- [ ] API Uptime: >99.9%

### Long-term Goals (Quarter 1)
- [ ] Cost reduction: 20%
- [ ] Throughput increase: 15%
- [ ] User satisfaction: >90%
- [ ] Zero critical failures
- [ ] Successful model updates
