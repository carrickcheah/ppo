# app3 - Simplified PPO Scheduling System TODO

## Project Overview
Build a simplified PPO-based scheduling system using pre-assigned machines from real production data. The system learns to select which task to schedule next while respecting sequence constraints and machine availability.

- **20_jobs.json**: 65 tasks, 20 families (training stage 2) 
- **40_jobs.json**: 130 tasks, 40 families (training stage 3)
- **60_jobs.json**: 195 tasks, 60 families (training stage 4)
- **100_jobs.json**: 327 tasks, 100 families (training stage 5)
- **200_jobs.json**: 650+ tasks, 200 families (training stage 6)
- **500_jobs.json**: 1600+ tasks, 500 families (production scale)
