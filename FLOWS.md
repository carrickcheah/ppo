# PPO Scheduling System - Workflow Documentation

## System Overview

The PPO scheduling system uses deep reinforcement learning to optimize production scheduling. This document outlines the complete workflow from data ingestion to schedule visualization.

## Constraint Categories

### Hard Constraints (Environment Physics)
1. **Sequence Within Family**
   - Jobs like "1/4", "2/4", "3/4" must execute in order
   - Enforced through `is_available` state

2. **Machine Requirements**
   - Jobs MUST use machines specified in `Machine_v`
   - Single: "80" ’ occupies machine 80
   - Multiple: "57,64,65,66,74" ’ occupies ALL 5 machines simultaneously
   - No alternatives allowed

3. **No Time Overlap**
   - A machine cannot process multiple jobs simultaneously
   - Multi-machine jobs block ALL their required machines

### Soft Constraints (Learned Through Rewards)
1. **Meet Deadlines** - Higher reward for on-time completion
2. **Prioritize Important Jobs** - Bonus for `IsImportant=1` jobs
3. **Efficiency** - Minimize total makespan
4. **Load Balancing** - Distribute work evenly

### Deployment Constraints (Applied at Runtime)
- **Working Hours** - Only schedule during factory operating hours
- Applied as post-processing filter, not part of training

## Data Processing Pipeline

### 1. Data Extraction from MariaDB
```
tbl_jo_txn + tbl_jo_process ’ Raw Job Data
              “
    Calculate Processing Time:
    If CapMin_d = 1 and CapQty_d > 0:
        hours = (JoQty_d / (CapQty_d * 60)) + (SetupTime_d / 60)
              “
    Parse Machine Requirements:
    Machine_v = "57,64,65,66,74" ’ required_machines = [57,64,65,66,74]
              “
    Create Job Object with all constraints
```

### 2. Environment State Representation
```
For each job:
- is_available: Can it be scheduled? (sequence check)
- urgency_score: How close to deadline?
- processing_time: Duration in hours
- is_important: Priority flag
- required_machines: List of ALL machines needed

For each machine:
- is_occupied: Currently processing?
- time_until_free: When available?
- current_job: What's running?
```

### 3. Action Space & Masking
```
Action = (job_index, primary_machine_index)

Valid only if:
- Job is available (sequence satisfied)
- ALL required machines are free
- No constraint violations

When action taken:
- Block ALL required machines
- Update machine schedules
- Mark job as scheduled
```

## Training Workflow

### Phase 1: Data Pipeline
- Implement correct processing time formula
- Parse multi-machine requirements
- Connect to production database

### Phase 2: Environment Setup
- Handle multi-machine occupation
- Remove working hours (training assumes 24/7)
- Implement proper action masking

### Phase 3: Model Architecture
```
Input: Variable number of jobs (10-1000+)
         “
Job Transformer Encoder
         “
Machine State Encoder
         “
Cross-Attention Layer
         “
Policy Head ’ Action probabilities
Value Head ’ State value estimate
```

### Phase 4: Curriculum Learning
```
Stage 1: 10 jobs, 5 machines ’ Learn basic rules
Stage 2: 50 jobs, 20 machines ’ Learn strategies
Stage 3: 200 jobs, 50 machines ’ Learn scaling
Stage 4: Full production scale ’ Final training
```

## Deployment Workflow

### 1. Inference Pipeline
```
Receive job request ’ Load trained model
                   ’ Create environment
                   ’ Run PPO inference
                   ’ Get raw schedule (24/7)
                   ’ Apply working hours filter
                   ’ Return valid schedule
```

### 2. Working Hours Filter
```python
# Post-process schedule for actual factory hours
for scheduled_job in raw_schedule:
    if not in_working_hours(scheduled_job.start_time):
        shift_to_next_valid_window(scheduled_job)
```

## Key Improvements from Previous Version

1. **Multi-Machine Understanding**: Jobs can require multiple machines simultaneously
2. **Correct Processing Time**: Using capacity-based formula from production
3. **Working Hours Separation**: Training on 24/7, filtering at deployment
4. **No Hardcoded Strategies**: Pure learning from experience

## Performance Monitoring

### Training Metrics
- Episode rewards
- Constraint violations (should ’ 0)
- Average makespan
- On-time delivery rate

### Production Metrics
- Schedule generation time (<1 second)
- Real on-time delivery rate
- Machine utilization rates
- Comparison with current scheduler

## Emergency Procedures

### Model Failure
- Log error with full context
- Return error response (no fallback)
- Alert operations team
- NO mock schedulers or degraded mode

### Performance Issues
- Monitor inference time
- Check constraint satisfaction
- Validate data pipeline
- Consider retraining if needed
